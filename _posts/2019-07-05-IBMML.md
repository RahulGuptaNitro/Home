## Machine Learning with Python By IBM
### (July'19)

This Machine Learning with Python course dives into the basics of Machine Learning using Python. 
I learnt about Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning and looked into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and did a comparison of each.
Looked at real-life examples of Machine Learning and how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!


Explored many algorithms and models:
Algorithms: Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Dimensional Reduction.
Models: Train/Test Split, Root Mean Squared Error, and Random Forests.


Also got a Badge from IBM regarding the course
