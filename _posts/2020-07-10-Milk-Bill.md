<center><h2>Android App using Flutter</h2></center>
 
 
Built an app to calculate the bill of milk purchased. Built it using Flutter in which I integrated a calendar and on each date a person can store quantity of milk and 
it automatically marks the date and one can generate bill whenever they want. It is an offline app without using third party database.

Dependencies used:
* table_calendar
* shared_preferences
