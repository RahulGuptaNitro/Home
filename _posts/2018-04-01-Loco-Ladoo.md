<center><h2>Android App Project</h2></center>

<br/>

It is a basic android app containing webview, back as well as refresh button. It also has banner ad implementation in it. This app was made through Android Studio.

I started working on this app in holiday break after my twelfth boards and published on play store. It has around 30,000 downloads.
