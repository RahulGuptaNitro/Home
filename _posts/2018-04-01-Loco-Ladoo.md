<center><h2>Android App Project</h2></center>

<br/>

It is a webview app in which I have done some modifications and integrated ads. I also have deployed seperate refresh and back button.

About the app: There was a live trivia app called Loco. And this app (Loco Ladoo) provided
hints for the questions asked in Loco. I built it in my 12th standard.

It has 30,000+ downloads on play store.
