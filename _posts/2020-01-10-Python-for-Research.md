## HarvardX PH526x Python for Research from HarvardX.
### (Dec'19 - Jan'20)


This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python 
courses available, most typically do not go deep enough to apply Python skills to research projects. In this course, 
after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, I learnt about tools commonly used in research settings.

Using a combination of a guided introduction and more independent in-depth exploration, I got to practice new Python skills 
with various case studies chosen for their scientific breadth and their coverage of different Python features.
