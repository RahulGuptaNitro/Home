## Campus Ambassador- Indian Road Safety Camppaign
### (Jan'19 - June'19)

Indian Road Safety Campaign, is the road safety initiative of Solve, a trust started by the students and alumni of IIT Delhi to solve the problems plaguing the society on the ground level. IRSC (Solve) is the largest youth led organisation working towards the mission of making Indian Roads Safer, focusing on reducing the number of deaths caused by road accidents across India.

Currently, It has grown to be a youth led national level organization with the collaborative and supportive effort of MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways). The active involvement of governmental bodies and international bodies like United Nations indicate that it has been successfully recognised by the government for its work towards road safety.

Being part of IRSC, I have worked on various initiatives of road safety across Lucknow.
