## About 

It is a basic android app containing webview, back as well as refresh button. It also has banner ad implementation in it. This app was made through Android Studio.

I started working on this app in holiday break after my twelfth boards and published on play store. It has around 30,000 downloads.

You can download the app from [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antitech.locoladoo).

You can view the code on [github](https://github.com/RahulGuptaNitro/LOCO-Ladoo).
