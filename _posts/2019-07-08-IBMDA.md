## Python for Data Analysis
### (July'19)

Learnt how to analyze data using Python. From the basics of Python to exploring many different types of data, I learnt how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!

Some features of the course-
Import data sets
Clean and prepare data for analysis
Manipulate pandas DataFrame
Summarize data
Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
Build data pipelines
Data Analysis with Python is delivered through lecture, hands-on labs, and assignments. It includes following parts:

Data Analysis libraries: learnt to use Pandas DataFrames, Numpy multi-dimentional arrays, and SciPy libraries to work with a various datasets. Introduction to pandas, an open-source library, and used it to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets. Introduced to another open-source library, scikit-learn, and used some of its machine learning algorithms to build smart models and make cool predictions.
