## Campus Ambassador (Jan'19- Mar'19)

Mechanica is the technical festival of Mechanical Engineering, presented by Mechanical Engineering Association (MEA), the largest of its kind at IIT Madras. The fest was started as a humble attempt to strengthen the foundations of mechanical students, and, pave a way for them to understand theory in the context of real life, with a glistening variety of contests and events. An event in Mechanica standing out as one of the best in the country is Robotics, its prominence being in the nature and novelty of the questions asked.

I promoted this event on Social Media and in my campus.
