## Campus Ambassador- IIM Rohtak's Infusion

Infusion is the annual management, social, cultural and sports festival of the Indian Institute of Management Rohtak. It is a three-day long event held in the second weekend of January every year. The first edition of Infusion happened in 2013, which witnessed a footfall of students from over 50 colleges across the country.
With 6 editions completed successfully, Infusion is becoming one of the biggest B-school festivals of the country. Infusion is a studentâ€“run festival which caters primarily to the youth and includes cultural, sports and management competitions at National level.

I was appointed Campus Ambassador to promote the IIM Rohtak's Infusion'19 in my campus.
