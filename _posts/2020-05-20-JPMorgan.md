## JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Software Engineering Virtual Internship.
### (May'20 - May'20)


JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Software Engineering Virtual Internship was a great experience for me to apply my technical skills to a 
hypothetical request from the firm’s trading floor to analyze and visualize data in a new way.

It was a great learning opportunity for me as it gave me a platform to practice various software engineering concepts and tools like: 
* React, Python and Typescript 
* Git Bash and Patch
* Node Version Manager and Node.js
* REPL: an open-source programming environment 
* Perspective: JP Morgan’s open-source data visualization tool 

My works included:
* Establishing Financial Data Feeds
* Front-end Web Development
* Financial Data Analysis using Python
* Data Visualization with Perspective
