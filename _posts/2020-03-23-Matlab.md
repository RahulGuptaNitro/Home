## Programming with Matlab by Vanderbilt University.
### (Jan'20 - Mar'20)


MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an 
easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation. It is a special-purpose language 
that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of 
the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB 
programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such
as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of 
engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. And in this course, I learnt its major concepts.
