## Bit About Me

Hi! I am Rahul Kumar Gupta currently pursuing Information Technology Engineering from Noida Institute of Engineering & Technology.


I am deeply interested in the vast field of algorithms, fascinated by the emerging wonders of machine learning, and keen to learn
about software systems. My coursework has equipped me well with basic grounding and I'm eager to continue learning and diving deeper. For me, using CS, math, and concrete reasoning to solve complex real-world
problems is one of the things providing intrinsic meaning to life.
Programming makes me feel cheery and I am always ready to code and learn new things introduced to this huge Virtual World of Computer Science.
