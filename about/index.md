## Bit About Me

Hi! I am Rahul Kumar Gupta pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Lucknow.

I love programming. In my Eighth Standard when I was learning C++ as a part of curriculam and made a simple calculator program, I was very much astonished as well as furious about the computer that it can do anything following commands. From then, Computer is as a special part in my life. Programming makes me feel cheery and I am always ready to code and learn new things introduced to this huge Virtual World of Computer Science.
